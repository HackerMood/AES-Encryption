# AES-Encryption
To Encrypt / Decrypt any file using AES 256 encryption 

This project contains two main files, one of which is 
the encryptor and the other the decryptor, 
it uses an encryption algorithm (AES 256)

------------------- Encrypt ------------------ <br />
 File --> MoodEcrypt.py<br />
[<br />
  you need to modify the value of the password <br />
  which will be a string of your choice (encryption key)<br />
  <br />
  --> Line 32<br />
]<br />
<br />
[<br />
  And the encryption directory in which the images <br />
  to be encrypted are stored<br />
  
  --> Line 73<br />
]<br />
